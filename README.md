# Fair Distribution Whitelist

This is a list of 64.8 million Ethereum addresses that paid 0.004 ETH in gas fees between block 0 and block 23,000,000 (approximately up to mid-2025, based on Ethereum's block production rate of ~2.6 million blocks per year since genesis in July 2015). The whitelist was originally constructed as a generic anti-Sybil dataset which any project could use as the basis for an airdrop or governance token distribution.
